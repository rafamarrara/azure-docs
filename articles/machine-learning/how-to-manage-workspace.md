# Create and manage Azure Machine Learning workspaces in the Azure portal


In this article, you'll create, view, and delete [**Azure Machine Learning workspaces**](concept-workspace.md) in the Azure portal for [Azure Machine Learning](overview-what-is-azure-ml.md).  The portal is the easiest way to get started with workspaces but as your needs change or requirements for automation increase you can also create and delete workspaces [using the CLI](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md), [with Python code](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py&preserve-view=true) or [via the VS Code extension](tutorial-setup-vscode-extension.md).

## Create a workspace

To create a workspace, you need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) by using the credentials for your Azure subscription. 

1. In the upper-left corner of Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

      ![Create a new resource](./media/how-to-manage-workspace/create-workspace.gif)

1. Use the search bar to find **Machine Learning**.

1. Select **Machine Learning**.

1. In the **Machine Learning** pane, select **Create** to begin.

1. Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:

   Field|Description 
   ---|---
   Workspace name |Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. In this example, we use **docs-ws**. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others. The workspace name is case-insensitive.
   Subscription |Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.
   Resource group | Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use **docs-aml**. You need *contributor* or *owner* role to use an existing resource group.  For more information about access, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-assign-roles.md).
   Region | Select the Azure region closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.
   Workspace edition | Select **Basic** or **Enterprise**.  This workspace edition determines the features to which you'll have access and pricing. Learn more about [Basic and Enterprise edition offerings](overview-what-is-azure-ml.md#sku). 

    ![Configure your workspace](./media/how-to-manage-workspace/select-edition.png)

1. When you're finished configuring the workspace, select **Review + Create**.
2. Review the settings and make any additional changes or corrections. When you're satisfied with the settings, select **Create**.

   > [!Warning] 
   > It can take several minutes to create your workspace in the cloud.

   When the process is finished, a deployment success message appears. 
 
 1. To view the new workspace, select **Go to resource**.

### Download a configuration file

1. If you will be creating a [compute instance](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md#azure), skip this step.

1. If you plan to use code on your local environment that references this workspace, select  **Download config.json** from the **Overview** section of the workspace.  

   ![Download config.json](./media/how-to-manage-workspace/configure.png)
   
   Place the file into  the directory structure with your Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks. It can be in the same directory, a subdirectory named *.azureml*, or in a parent directory. When you create a compute instance, this file is added to the correct directory on the VM for you.
## <a name="view"></a>Find a workspace

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the top search field, type **Machine Learning**.  

1. Select **Machine Learning**.

   ![Search for Azure Machine Learning workspace](./media/how-to-manage-workspace/find-workspaces.png)

1. Look through the list of workspaces found. You can filter based on subscription, resource groups, and locations.  

1. Select a workspace to display its properties.

## Delete a workspace

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Delete**  at the top of the workspace you wish to delete.

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [aml-delete-resource-group](../../includes/aml-delete-resource-group.md)]

## Troubleshooting

### Resource provider errors

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-resource-provider](../../includes/machine-learning-resource-provider.md)]

### Moving the workspace

> [!WARNING]
> Moving your Azure Machine Learning workspace to a different subscription, or moving the owning subscription to a new tenant, is not supported. Doing so may cause errors.

### Deleting the Azure Container Registry

The Azure Machine Learning workspace uses Azure Container Registry (ACR) for some operations. It will automatically create an ACR instance when it first needs one.

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-delete-acr](../../includes/machine-learning-delete-acr.md)]
